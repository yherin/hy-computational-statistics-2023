    "4. Simulate a coin flip competition between a person using a fair coin and a person using a biased coin where the competition consists of 100 coin flips. How large a bias do you need for the biased coin to lead to 95% probability of the person using the biased coin to obtain more heads than the person using the fair coin? What if you want 99% probability?\n",
